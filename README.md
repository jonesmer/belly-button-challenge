# belly-button-challenge
a javascript exercise

This repository contains an html page that displays information about belly button bacteria. It is deployed to GitHub pages; the information is dynamic and controlled by a javascript file.

I didn't really understand how to get started on this challenge, so I got help from a tutor. He sort of went through the entire javascript code for me, but I did recreate it myself (mostly without referring to the script we wrote during my tutoring session), and played around with some parameters to try to better understand how and why they were where they were.
